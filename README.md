# Bitcoin-Classification-and-Prediction
This is our Bitcoin Machine Learning Project Repository.
This project is divided into two parts, 1)Classification - whether the price will increase
after n minutes or not and 2)Prediction - what will be the price after n minutes. For building
classification and prediction models, we have used different set of features.We implemented various models like Logistic regression, Neural Network for classification part along with Huber Regression, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for prediction part and compared their performance. Using these models one can plan investments looking into the predicted trends.
